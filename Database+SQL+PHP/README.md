## I have made a Library database with SQL and then created a website with HTML and PHP to connect to that database. 
### ***Unfortunately, GitHub cannot host PHP files so I could only include the files in a folder here. Some screenshots of the PHP pages can be found in the Library_Website_Screenshots.docx file.***

## Below is a breakdown of my developement process and any files for that step:

## 1. Requirements/Objectives of Database Design
### The requirements for the database are outlined in the Library_Database_Requirements.docx.

## 2. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
### The ERD for the database can be found in the Library_ERD.pdf.

## 3. Relational Model
### The Relational Model can be found in the Library_Relational_Model.xlsx.

## 4. Database Implementation and Beginning Inserts
### These can be found in the LibraryDatabase.sql file.

## 5. SQL Queries Using the Database
### These can be located in the Libary_SQL_Queries.sql file. The queries and screenshots of their results can also be found in the Library_SQL_Queries+Results.docx.

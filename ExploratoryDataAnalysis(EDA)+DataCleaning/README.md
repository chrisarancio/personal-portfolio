# I have provided examples for two steps of the data analysis process: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis.
## Data Cleaning
### The Data Cleaning is done with Python and the code can be found in the DataCleaning(Python).ipynb notebook file. My reasoning for each data cleaning step can be found in the DataCleaningReport.docx file.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### The EDA is done in R and can be found in the EDA-R.ipynb notebook file. My conclusions about the data appear in bold at the end of each section in the EDA-R.ipynb file.

## I have provided examples for two steps of the data analysis process: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis.
## The Data Cleaning is done with Python and the code can be found in the DataCleaning(Python).ipynb notebook file. The EDA is done in R and can be found in the EDA-R.ipynb notebook file.
## My reasoning for each data cleaning step can be found in the DataCleaningReport.docx file. My conclusions from the EDA appear in bold at the end of each section in the EDA-R.ipynb file.

# Battleship in Java
## This is a single player recreation of Battleship where the player will select how many torpedoes (guesses) they will get to sink the randomized positions of the ships.

## Download and run the .jar file to play Battleship
### The .jar file can be downloaded from GitHub. The program can then be run on the Command Line/Terminal on a computer with Java installed using the command: 
**java -jar 'path of PlayBattleship.jar here'**

## The .java files for the main BattleshipDriver class along with the supporting classes of Battleship and Ship can also be found in this repository. The CodeTester.java class automatically guesses across the rows to show a complete round of the game.

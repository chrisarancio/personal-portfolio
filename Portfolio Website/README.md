## This folder includes the HTML and CSS files that I used to create my portfolio website. JavaScript is embedded in the HTML file to make the "About Me" Section interactive and also to adjust the styling so the website is still interactable and appears correctly on a smaller mobile screen.

Note: The "Contact Me" form utilizes a script from Jamie Wilson at https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets to implement some of its functionality. This is noted in the HTML file itself as well.
